# Number-Guessing
This is a basic web-based number guessing game, in which you and the computer need to guess a number between 0 to 9 (both inclusive). 
There is a **secret target** number between 0 to 9, which is only revealed after a round is over. *The guess which is closest to the secret target number wins the round*. In case of tie between you and computer, it will be you who win the round.
